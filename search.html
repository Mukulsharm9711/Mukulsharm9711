          <h3>Why should we protect plants?</h3>
        </a>

        <p>The United Nations General Assembly declared 2020 as the International Year of Plant Health.
          According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), plants make up 80% of the food
          we eat, and plant pests are responsible for the loss of up to 40% of global food crops, and for trade losses
          in agricultural products exceeding USD 220 billion annually. Plant breeding is a major driver to secure the
          availability of
          food by strengthening resistance to plant diseases, insects and with that reducing crop loss.

          <h3>What is the education system in India?</h3>
        </a>

        <p>The school system in India has four levels: lower primary (age 6 to 10), upper primary (11 and 12),
          high (13 to 15) and higher secondary (17 and 18).
          The lower primary school is divided into five “standards”, upper primary school into two, high school into
          three and higher secondary into two. Students have to learn a common curriculum largely (except for regional
          changes in mother tongue) till the end of high school.

          <h3>What is called street dog?</h3>
        </a>

        <span>Street dogs may be stray dogs, pets which have strayed from or are abandoned by their owners, or may be
          feral animals that have
          never been owned. Street dogs may be stray purebreds, true mixed-breed dogs, or unbred landraces such as the
          Indian pariah dog. Street dog overpopulation can cause problems for the societies in which they live,
          so campaigns to spay and neuter them are sometimes implemented. They tend
          to differ from rural free-ranging dogs in their skill sets, socialization, and ecological effects.</span>

          <h3>What is the biggest pollution problem in India?</h3>
        </a>

        <p>There are multiple environmental issues in India. Air pollution, water pollution, garbage, domestically
          prohibited goods and pollution of the natural environment are all challenges for India. Nature is also causing
          some drastic effects on India.
          The situation was worse between 1947 through 1995. According to data collected and environmental assessments
          studied by World Bank experts,
          between 1995 through 2010, India has made some of the fastest progress in addressing its environmental issues
          and improving its environmental quality in the world.
          However, Pollution still remains a major challenge and opportunity for the country.
